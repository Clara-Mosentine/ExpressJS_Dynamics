<h1>My First CSS Example</h1>


<span class = "aw">   <a href="SpherePage.html">Not a dynamic page!</a>   </span>
<span class = "aw">   <a href="realDynamic.js">A more dynamic page!</a>   </span>


<div class = "ti">The Basics of HTML</div>


<h2>What do the basic tags do?</h2>
<span class = "aw"> Basic tags allow formatting and defining sections of a webpage!</span>

<h2>How do you nest tags?</h2>
<div class = "aw">
  You start the first tag,
  <ul>
  <li>and then add each subtag</li>
  <li>to differentiate which elements</li>
  <li>are separate entries to the nest!</li>
  <li>(if your tag is list entries, for example)</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h2>What's the difference between div and span?</h2>
<span class = "aw">Div commands "divide" two bodies of text, analogous to pressing the enter key on a text document. </span><br>
<span class = "aw">Span commands <b>DON'T</b> "press enter", and can be used in the same line as other elements <i>(hence why they are sometimes called "inline" commands)</i>.</span>

<h2>How do you create links?</h2>
<span class = "aw">   <a href="https://kurmasgvsu.github.io/">Like this!</a>   </span>

<h2>How do you embed images?</h2>
<span class = "aw">First you specify image source, then you specify alternate text in case the image is unavailable.</span><br>

<h2>How do you make rules in the .html document's head using the [.style] tag?</h2>
<span class = "aw">You use the style command to define an area where styles and rules will be written. This allows you to use CSS to make overarching text classes, background changes, and more. Then, all you have to do is reference which rule you want applied when!</span>

<h2>How do you link to an external stylesheet (e.g., [link rel="stylesheet"...)?</h2>
<span class = "aw">First, you define that you are linking to a stylesheet, using the "rel=" input. After that, you simply link to whichever .css file you want.</span>

<h2>What is the basic syntax for setting properties on an element (font, color, etc.)?</h2>
<span class = "aw">Each property on an element can be identified with its name (for instance, <b>color</b>). A colon marks where the property name ends and where the new setting for the property begins. After this, the new property value is given, and the statement is ended with a semicolon (for instance, <b>color:blue;</b>)</span>


<h2>How do you use selectors (class, tag, and id)?</h2>
<span class = "aw">You can make classes, tags, and ids by creating the new name of the selector, and then use curly brackets to enclose all of the specifications within. Then, whenever you use the name of that selector within two arrows, the following text will be run under the "rules" of that selector.</span>


<h2>What are ways to alter the box model (borders, margin, padding)?</h2>
<span class = "aw">Borders, margins, and padding all help to make your text easier to read. In the case of padding, a text formatting class can specify an indent at the start of any new paragraph. By indicating "padding: X%", you can change X to make the indent as pronounced or subtle as you'd like.</span>
